# Covid-19-Vaccination-Trend-Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world significantly, causing widespread illness and death, disrupting economies, and changing the way people live and work. To better understand the impact of the pandemic, we can perform trend analysis using Power BI, a business intelligence tool that can provide interactive visualizations and insights from data.

Objectives:

The objective of this project is to create a COVID-19 dashboard using Power BI that can help us analyze the following:

The number of confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths due to COVID-19 globally and for specific countries and regions.
The trends in the number of confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths over time.
The factors that contribute to the spread of the virus, such as population density, travel, and healthcare infrastructure.
The effectiveness of measures taken to control the spread of the virus, such as lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccination campaigns.
